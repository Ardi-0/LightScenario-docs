## Lighting Scenarios System

Create, save, and manage multiple lighting setups in one scene.

### What are Lighting Scenarios?

Scenarios are **saved lighting configurations**. Instead of duplicating your entire scene for different lighting moods, you can:
- Save unlimited lighting setups in one file
- Switch between them instantly
- Blend scenarios together
- Animate transitions between scenarios

**Use Cases:**
- Archviz: Day/Night/Golden Hour lighting
- Product: Studio/Dramatic/Soft lighting variations
- Animation: Different times of day
- Presentations: Multiple lighting options for clients

### Creating Your First Scenario

#### Step 1: Set Up Your Lights

1. Create your scene with objects
2. Add lights and adjust them for your first lighting look

3. Your lights update
4. Panel shows special "Scenario Mode" UI

**What You Can Do in Scenario Mode:**
- Quick scenario switching
- See which scenario is active
- Access scenario-specific tools
- **Auto-tagging**: New lights automatically added to current scenario

**To Exit Scenario Mode:**

1. Click **"Exit Scenario Mode"** button
2. Returns to normal panel

**üí° Tip:** Use Scenario Mode when actively working on specific scenarios.

### Scenario Blending (A to B)

**Blend between two scenarios** for smooth transitions or in-between looks.

#### Step-by-Step: Create a Blend

1. Click **"Scenario Blend (A to B)"** section
2. **Select Scenario A**: Choose first scenario (e.g., "Day")
3. **Select Scenario B**: Choose second scenario (e.g., "Night")
4. Click **"Enter Blend Mode"**

#### Adjust the Blend

1. Use the **"Blend Factor"** slider
   - `0%` = 100% Scenario A
   - `50%` = Equal mix of A and B
   - `100%` = 100% Scenario B
2. **Lights update in real-time** as you drag the slider
3. Find the perfect in-between look

#### Save or Exit

**To Save the Blend as New Scenario:**
1. Click **"Save Current as New Scenario"**
2. Name it (e.g., "Sunset")
3. Now you have a permanent in-between scenario

**To Exit Blend Mode:**
1. Click **"Exit Blend Mode"**

**üí° Pro Tip:** Use blending to create variations without manual light adjustment!

### Multi-Scenario Mixer (Advanced)

**Mix multiple scenarios simultaneously** with individual weight control.

#### When to Use Mixer

- Combine 3+ scenarios
- Need precise control over each scenario's contribution
- Creating complex, layered lighting

#### Step-by-Step: Use the Mixer

1. Click **"Scenario Mixer"** section
2. Click **"Create Mixer Slot"**

#### Configure Mixer Slots

1. Each slot has:
   - **Scenario Selector**: Choose which scenario
   - **Weight Slider**: Control contribution (0.0 to 1.0)
2. Add multiple slots (up to 30 scenarios!)
3. Adjust weights for each

#### Examples

**Example 1: Time Blending**
- Slot 1: "Morning" (weight 0.3)
- Slot 2: "Noon" (weight 0.5)
- Slot 3: "Afternoon" (weight 0.2)
- **Result**: Custom time-of-day blend

**Example 2: Style Mixing**
- Slot 1: "Studio" (weight 0.6)
- Slot 2: "Dramatic" (weight 0.3)
- Slot 3: "Colorful" (weight 0.1)
- **Result**: Unique lighting style

#### Clear/Reset Mixer

1. Click **"Clear All Weights"** to reset everything to 0
2. Or delete individual slots

### Animation Helpers

**Keyframe transitions between scenarios** for animations.

#### Step-by-Step: Animate Scenario Transition

1. Go to **"Animation Helpers"** section
2. Click **"Add Blend Helper"**
3. **Configure the helper:**
   - **Name**: "Day to Night Transition"
   - **Scenario A**: "Day"
   - **Scenario B**: "Night"
   - **Blend Factor**: Start at 0.0

#### Create the Animation

1. **Frame 1**: Set Blend Factor to `0.0` (100% Day)
   - Hover over blend factor slider
   - Press `I` to keyframe
2. **Frame 120**: Move timeline to frame 120
   - Set Blend Factor to `1.0` (100% Night)
   - Press `I` to keyframe
3. **Play animation**: Smooth transition from day to night!

**üí° Tip:** Multiple animation helpers can run simultaneously for complex sequences.

### Scenario Tagging

**Organize lights** by assigning them to scenarios without duplication.

#### What is Scenario Tagging?

Instead of duplicating lights:
- **One light** can belong to **multiple scenarios**
- Each scenario remembers that light's settings
- Cleaner scene, less clutter

#### Step-by-Step: Tag Lights

1. **Select light(s)** in your scene
2. Go to **"Scenario Tagging"** section
3. Enter scenario name in **"Tag with Scenario"** field
4. Click **"Apply Tag"**

‚úÖ Light is now tagged with that scenario!

#### View Tagged Lights

1. In Lights Hierarchy, tagged lights show scenario badges
2. Filter by scenario tag using **"Tag Filter"** dropdown

#### Multi-Scenario Lights

One light in multiple scenarios:
1. Select light
2. Tag with "Studio"
3. Tag same light with "Dramatic"
4. Light now belongs to both scenarios with different settings

### Managing Scenarios

#### Rename a Scenario

1. Find scenario in list
2. Click **rename icon** (pencil)
3. Enter new name
4. Press Enter

#### Delete a Scenario

1. Find scenario in list
2. Click **delete icon** (X)

### Scenario Best Practices

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Use clear, descriptive names ("Studio_Soft", "Outdoor_Noon")
- Save often as you work
- Test switching before final renders
- Use tags for lights that appear in multiple scenarios

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Create 50+ scenarios (gets messy - use variations instead)
- Delete scenarios without backups
- Forget to save changes before switching
- Mix scenario systems with manual light hiding

**üí° Workflow Tip:**
1. Create base scenarios first (Day, Night, Studio)
2. Use blending to create variations
3. Save successful blends as new scenarios
4. Use animation helpers for sequences
