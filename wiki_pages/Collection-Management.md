### Collection Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Create logical hierarchies (Scene → Lighting → Types → Lights)
- Use consistent naming
- Organize early in project
- Keep related lights together

**Example Hierarchy:**
```
Scene Collection
└── Lighting
    ├── Key Lights
    │   ├── Key_Main
    │   └── Key_Fill
    ├── Rim Lights
    │   ├── Rim_Left
    │   └── Rim_Right
    └── Background Lights
        └── BG_Fill
```
